Hey There,
I have this repo to have my portfolio webstie manage,
the flow I'm using is main <- Portfolio <- anny <- Versions.....

any new experiment can be built from main as main branch has nothing but starter code of react, in case you need a new version, that has to be done from anny and once devloped tested verified can be added in portfolio.
in future will have a Portfolio versions as we need multiple layout design of portfolio, so we will build those later into the year.
